# Multiplicative Inverse using Euclidean Algorithm.

## Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’, find modular multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’. The modular multiplicative inverse is an integer ‘x’ such that. 

> ###  *a x ≅ 1 (mod m)*


The value of x should be in { 1, 2, … m-1}, i.e., in the range of integer modulo m. 

**( Note that x cannot be 0 as a*0 mod m will never be 1 )**


*The multiplicative inverse of “a modulo m” exists if and only if a and m are relatively prime (i.e., if gcd(a, m) = 1).*
